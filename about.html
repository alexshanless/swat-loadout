					<h2>
						<i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Our Mission

					<div class="notes" style="border: none; background: transparent; padding: 0;">
						<p style="color: #d0d0d0; font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 15px;">
							DAGRE is a Ready or Not milsim community dedicated to teaching and applying real-world TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in tactical operations. We proudly welcome all brothers and sisters who choose to join our ranks and become part of one of the gaming community's finest Ready or Not organizations.
						</p>
						<p style="color: #d0d0d0; font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 15px;">
							At DAGRE, we value genuine connection. Our mission is to enhance your Ready or Not gameplay while building a positive, motivating atmosphere that uplifts members in their day-to-day lives. We aim to provide an exceptional experience for every player—regardless of their background—while promoting teamwork, discipline, and authentic tactical gameplay in Ready or Not.
						</p>
						<p style="color: #d0d0d0; font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 15px;">
							For Ready or Not, we offer consistent trainings, raids, and full-scale deployments, all designed to sharpen your tactical skills and help you master the game. If your goal is improvement in Ready or Not, we stand beside you every step of the way to ensure you achieve it.
						</p>
						<p style="color: #00ff88; font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; font-weight: 500;">
							All we ask is that you remain motivated and active. In return, you'll always have a committed, welcoming community to game with, learn from, and hang out alongside.

				<!-- Deployments Section -->
				<div class="rules-card" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
					<h2>
						<i class="fas fa-crosshairs"></i> Deployments

					<div class="rules-grid" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
						<div class="rule-item">
							<i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i>

					</div>
					<div class="notes">
						<p style="color: #d0d0d0; line-height: 1.7;">
							Deployments are pre-planned operations for which members will receive a notice several days in advance. These events represent some of DAGRE's most challenging and immersive mission sets. During deployments, communications will be restricted to Yellow Comms—meaning all dialogue must remain mission-focused, limited to callouts, coordination, and game-related communication only.
						</p>
						<p style="color: #d0d0d0; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 12px;">
							Deployments are conducted on Hard difficulty, requiring strict adherence to the TTPs taught during training. Precision is essential; even minor mistakes will be evaluated thoroughly. Your performance during these operations will directly influence your eligibility for promotion, continued advancement, or in some cases, demotion. Additionally, members may earn in-server currency based on overall performance and discipline.
						</p>

				<!-- Raids Section -->

					<div class="rules-grid" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
						<div class="rule-item">

					</div>
					<div class="notes">
						<p style="color: #d0d0d0; line-height: 1.7;">
							Raids function as shorter-notice versions of our standard deployments and follow nearly all of the same operational expectations. Members will receive limited advance warning before a Raid begins, requiring adaptability and readiness at all times.
						</p>
						<p style="color: #d0d0d0; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 12px;">
							Just like deployments, Raids operate under Yellow Comms, utilize Hard difficulty, and require full application of all TTPs learned during training. Performance is evaluated with the same level of detail, and results can influence promotions, demotions, and in-server currency rewards.
						</p>
						<p style="color: #d0d0d0; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 12px;">
							The structure is also identical: you will be assigned to a team, given a mission brief, and placed under a designated Team Lead, with oversight provided by a CO or NCO. A formal AAR will be issued afterward to highlight strengths and areas for improvement.
						</p>
						<p style="color: #ff6b35; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 12px; font-weight: 500;">
							In short, Raids are compressed, rapid-response deployments designed to test your readiness and discipline under shorter preparation timelines.

						<p style="color: #d0d0d0; line-height: 1.7;">
							DAGRE's training program is built on the principle of continuous improvement—striving to become 1% better with every session. Our trainings place strong emphasis on mastering TTPs and learning from past mistakes to ensure steady, measurable progress.
						</p>
						<p style="color: #d0d0d0; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 12px;">
							While the training environment is structured to be approachable and engaging, it is still expected to be taken seriously. Meaningful development comes from treating each session with focus, discipline, and a commitment to growth.
						</p>
						<p style="color: #d0d0d0; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 12px;">
							During training, members will work directly on correcting issues identified in previous deployments or raids. By leveraging detailed AARs, we can accurately identify performance gaps and address them through refined and updated TTPs.
						</p>
						<p style="color: #d0d0d0; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 12px;">
							This targeted approach ensures that every member receives a constructive learning experience that not only enhances individual skill but also strengthens overall mission success.
						</p>
						<p style="color: #00ff88; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 12px; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;">
							In DAGRE, training isn't just practice—it's preparation for excellence.
